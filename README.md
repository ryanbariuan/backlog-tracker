# Game Backlog-Tracker

A Sample MERN Stack Project where you can register and track your video game collection.

## How to use:

1. Create a user account on the website.
2. On the user profile click _Add Game_ to show the Add Game Form details.
3. You can set the status of the game you add via the Progress Information section.
4. If the console you own is not listed on the dropdown list of the platform/system, Add the console/platform via clicking the _Add Platform_ button to show the Add Platform Form. Once you added the platform of your choice you can now see it being added on the Add Game Form.
5. For the box-art you may put an Image Link address for your Game.
6. After submitting you can see all the collection you added via MyGames.
7. From there you can try to update/edit or delete the game. you can also add some progress notes.
8. If the game Added is already existing, it will not appear on the Games Page section.

## Project Improvements:

1. There will be some design improvements especially the look of the website (not yet responsive)
2. Will also add the following features when I have time like: progress notes managements, Game and Search filtering, User Reviews for the Games added.
